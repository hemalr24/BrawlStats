# BrawlStats

This Python app uses the [Brawl Stars API](https://developer.brawlstars.com/) to track and visualize player stats over time, including:

- **Trophy progression per brawler**
- **Overall ranked points history**

The app stores all data persistently and generates interactive graphs for visual analysis.
